// 5 steps to create MIDI sound
    //Get sequence and open it [Sequence sequencer = MidiSystem.getSequencer(); sequencer.open();]
    //Make a new sequence [Sequence sequence = new Sequence(timing, 4);]
    //Get new track from sequence [Track t = sequence.createTrack();]
    //Give track with midievents and give seqence to sequencer [t.add(MidiEvents); sequencer.setSequence(sequence);]
    //play the sequence [sequencer.start();]
