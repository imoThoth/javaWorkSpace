Requirement - When a key exist in the table it should be updated.
        

I didn't fully understand the instructions for this requirement.
I wasn't sure if the object which the key belongs to should be updated
or if the key itself was mean't to be updated.

I implemented a put mapping which updates the name and other value within the object.
