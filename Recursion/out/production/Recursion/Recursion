What is Recursion? A method which calls itself

Recursion Pros -:
    Bridges gap between elegance and complexity
    Reduce needs for complex loops and auxiliary data structures
    Reduce time complexity using memoization/caching
    Works well with recursive structures, trees, graphs. json objects

Recursion Cons -:
    Slowness due to CPU overload. Calling and recalling code
    Leads to memory errors/ stack overflow exceptions
    Can be unnecessarily complex if poorly constructed

Call Stack -: Abstraction which Operating.System uses to store method invocation/call in a programme
              Store memory address
              Store local information passed to object, method, variables
              Process isn't finished until the call stack is completed

Stop Value -: Uses a base condition, to stop further recursion... this prevents infinite recursions


Questions to ask when using Recursion -:
    What is my stop value? When can i no longer continue the algorithm?
    What is the smallest amount of work i can do in each iteration?
