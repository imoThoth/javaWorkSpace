Java has 8 different layouts.
One of this layout is known as the GridPane

The width and height of column are auto set to the size of biggest item

Columnn Constraints creates a maximum width/height for the columns
-* creating constraint for 3 buttons means creating 3 constraint tags
-* constraints are applied in order, eg first constraint is applied to the first button tag etc

hGap and vGap attribute define how many pixels between each rendered item, to create space
gridLineVisible attribute allows dev to view app with grid lines

Grid.columnSpan - allows item to span over one column
